# Rare Tokens Degenerate All Tokens: Improving Neural Text Generation via Adaptive Gradient Gating for Rare Token Embeddings
A Pytorch implementation of the paper:

[Rare Tokens Degenerate All Tokens: Improving Neural Text Generation via Adaptive Gradient Gating for Rare Token Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03127)
Sangwon Yu, Jongyoon Song, Heeseung Kim, Seong-min Lee, Woo-Jong Ryu, Sungroh Yoon

We present code for training models described in the paper, as well as pre-trained models.

# Setup
 - You need a python version >= 3.6
 - The implementation is based on a [fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq) 0.9.0.
 - Clone this repo and install requirements
 
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/ysw1021/AGG.git
      cd AGG
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
