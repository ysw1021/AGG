    Authors description:
    Our goal was to create a dataset balanced with respect to
    three factors: class type, frequency, and ambiguity.
    First of all, we aimed to include one class of nouns for
    each of the 21 unique beginners of the WordNet noun
    hierarchy4
    . We chose subclasses for each of these 21
    beginners that would represent a reasonably natural cluster:
    e.g., the hyponym social occasion for the unique beginner
    event. From each such class, we selected between 13 and 21
    nouns to be representative concepts for the class (e.g.,
    ceremony, feast, and graduation for the class social
    occasion).
    Secondly, we aimed to include about 1/3 high frequency
    nouns, 1/3 medium frequency, and 1/3 low frequency. Noun
    frequencies where estimated using the British National
    Corpus. We considered as highly frequent those nouns with
    frequency 1,000 or more; as medium frequent the nouns
    with between 1,000 and 100 occurrences; and those between
    100 and 5 as low frequent.
    Thirdly, we wanted the dataset to be balanced as to
    ambiguity, estimated on the basis of the number of senses in
    WordNet. Nouns with 4 or more senses were considered
    highly ambiguous; nouns with 2 or 3 senses medium
    ambiguous; and nouns with a single sense as not ambiguous.

    This dataset comprises a ranked list of 5231 words listed in 56 taxonomic categories by people
    who were asked to list as many exemplars of a given category ("a precious stone", "a unit of time",
    "a fruit", "a color", etc.). Participants had 30s to generate as many responses to each category as
    possible, after which time the next category name was presented.
    Included in this dataset are all words from the Battig and Montague (1969) norms listed with
    freq > 1.

    The goal of the sub-task is to group verbs into semantic categories. The data set consists of 45 verbs,
    belonging to 9 semantic classes. The classification scheme is inspired by P. Vinson & G. Vigliocco (2007),
    “Semantic Feature Production Norms for a Large Set of Objects and Events”, Behavior Research Methods,
    which in turn closely follows the classification proposed in Levin (1993). The data set consists of 44 concrete
    nouns, belonging to 6 semantic categories (four animates and two inanimates). The nouns are included in the
    feature norms described in McRae et al. (2005)
